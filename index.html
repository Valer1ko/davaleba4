            Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.
Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.
Designers are toolmakers. </p>
<p>
Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.
Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.
Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user. </p>
